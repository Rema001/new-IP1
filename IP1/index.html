     <h2>About Me</h2>
     <p>I'm a recent High-school graduate currently residing in Nairobi.The post-graduate life lived up to it's hype, though it come to grinding halt with a single question..<em>"what are you going to do now?"</em>Well after a couple of weeks soul-searching I settled on software development.Why you might ask? Look at it like this, while most of my peers were either looking to pick up a new language(french most likely)photography or learning how to dj, I saw that these skills would only be useful for a particular phase in your life.I decided to learn a universal language<strong>coding!</strong>Here is why;
       <ul>
         <li>It opens your up to whole other thought process."Everybody in this country shoild learn how to program a computer.. because it teaches you how to think" Steve Jobs</li>
         <li>It offers career flexibility.</li>
         <li><span class="important">It is fun</span></li>
       </ul>
